New TikTok users sign up with their emails, so each signup requires a text confirmation to activate the
new user's account.
Write a query to find the confirmation rate of users who confirmed their signups with text messages.
Round the result to 2 decimal places.
Hint- Use Joins
Assumptions:
● A user may fail to confirm several times with text. Once the signup is confirmed for a user,
they will not be able to initiate the signup again.
● A user may not initiate the signup confirmation process at all.

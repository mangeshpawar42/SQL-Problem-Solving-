Table: Orders
Column Name Type
order_number int
customer_number int
order_number is the primary key for this table.
This table contains information about the order ID and the customer ID.
Write an SQL query to find the customer_number for the customer who has placed the largest
number of orders.
The test cases are generated so that exactly one customer will have placed more orders than any
other customer.
The query result format is in the following example.
Input:
Orders table:
order_number customer_numbe
1 1
2 2
3 3
4 3



SELECT CUSTOMER_NUMBER
FROM (
  SELECT CUSTOMER_NUMBER, SUM(ORDER_NUMBER) AS TOTAL
  FROM ORDERS
  GROUP BY CUSTOMER_NUMBER
) AS TotalOrders
ORDER BY TOTAL DESC
LIMIT 1;


------------ANOTHER ----------------------

WITH TotalOrders AS (
  SELECT CUSTOMER_NUMBER, SUM(ORDER_NUMBER) AS TOTAL
  FROM ORDERS
  GROUP BY CUSTOMER_NUMBER
)
SELECT CUSTOMER_NUMBER
FROM (
  SELECT CUSTOMER_NUMBER, TOTAL, RANK() OVER (ORDER BY TOTAL DESC) AS rnk
  FROM TotalOrders
) RankedOrders
WHERE rnk = 1;

---------------------------------------------------------

WITH TotalOrders AS (
  SELECT
    CUSTOMER_NUMBER,
    SUM(ORDER_NUMBER) OVER (PARTITION BY CUSTOMER_NUMBER) AS TOTAL,
    RANK() OVER (PARTITION BY CUSTOMER_NUMBER ORDER BY SUM(ORDER_NUMBER) DESC) AS RNK
  FROM ORDERS
)

SELECT CUSTOMER_NUMBER
FROM TotalOrders
WHERE RNK = 1;

------------------0-0-0-0-----------------
COUNT ALSO GIVE THE SAME OUTPUT

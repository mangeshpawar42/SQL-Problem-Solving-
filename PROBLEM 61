The query result format is in the following example.
Input:
Point table:
x
-1
0
2


SELECT 
   MIN(ABS(P1.X - P2.X)) AS SHORTEST_DISTANCE
FROM POINT P1
CROSS JOIN POINT P2
WHERE P1.X<>P2.X;



==============================================


SELECT MIN(ABS(P1.X - P2.X)) AS SHORTEST
FROM Point AS P1
JOIN Point AS P2 ON P1.X < P2.X;

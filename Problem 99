Assume you are given the tables below containing information on Snapchat users, their ages, and
their time spent sending and opening snaps. Write a query to obtain a breakdown of the time spent
sending vs. opening snaps (as a percentage of total time spent on these activities) for each age
group.
Hint- Use join and case
Output the age bucket and percentage of sending and opening snaps. Round the percentage to 2
decimal places.
Notes:
● You should calculate these percentages:
○ time sending / (time sending + time opening)
○ time opening / (time sending + time opening)
● To avoid integer division in percentages, multiply by 100.0 and not 100.

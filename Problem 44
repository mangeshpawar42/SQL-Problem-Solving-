Table: Employee
Column Name Type
id int
name varchar
department varchar
managerId int
id is the primary key column for this table.
Each row of this table indicates the name of an employee, their department, and the id of their
manager.
If managerId is null, then the employee does not have a manager.
No employee will be the manager of themself.
Write an SQL query to report the managers with at least five direct reports.
Return the result table in any order.
The query result format is in the following example.
Input:
Employee table:
id name department managerId
101 John A None
102 Dan A 101
103 James A 101
104 Amy A 101
105 Anne A 101

SELECT NAME

GROUP BY MANAGERID
HAVING COUNT(*) >= 5);

--------------------ANOTHER APPROACH------------------

WITH manager AS (
  SELECT DISTINCT
    managerId,
    COUNT(managerId) OVER (PARTITION BY managerId) [manager5]
  FROM Employee
)
SELECT e.name
FROM manager m JOIN Employee e ON e.id = m.managerId
WHERE m.manager5 >= 5;


----------ANOTHER APPROACH ----------

DIRECT USED JOIN 

SELECT EE.NAME 
FROM EMPLOYEE E
JOIN EMPLOYEE EE ON E.MANAGERID = EE.ID
GROUP BY E.NAME
HAVING COUNT(E.ID) >=5;

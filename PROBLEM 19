Table: Delivery
Column Name Type
delivery_id int
customer_id int
order_date date
customer_pref_delivery_date date
delivery_id is the primary key of this table.
The table holds information about food delivery to customers that make orders at some date and
specify a preferred delivery date (on the same order date or after it).
If the customer's preferred delivery date is the same as the order date, then the order is called
immediately; otherwise, it is called scheduled.
Write an SQL query to find the percentage of immediate orders in the table, rounded to 2 decimal
places.
The query result format is in the following example.
Input:
Delivery table:
delivery_id customer_id order_date customer_pref_elivery_date
1                 1     2019-08-01       2019-08-02
2                 5     2019-08-02       2019-08-02
3                 1     2019-08-11       2019-08-11
4                 3     2019-08-24       2019-08-26
5                 4     2019-08-21       2019-08-22
6                 2     2019-08-11       2019-08-13

SELECT 
    ROUND(
          SUM(CASE WHEN 
                  ORDER_DATE = CUSTOMER_PREF_DELIVERY_DATE THEN 1 ELSE 0)/COUNT(DELIVERY_ID)*100,2 
    ) AS IMMEDIATE_DELIVERY
FROM DELIVERY;

ANOTHER APPROACH: 

[OPTIMIZED SOLUTION]

SELECT ROUND(
        (SELECT COUNT(*) FROM DELIVERY
          WHERE ORDER_DATE = CUSTOMER_PREF_DELIVERY_DATE)/COUNT(*)*100,2
) AS IMMEDIATE_DELIVERY
FROM DELIVERY;

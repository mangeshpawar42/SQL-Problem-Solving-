Q45.
Table: Student
Column Name Type
student_id int
student_name varchar
gender varchar
dept_id int
student_id is the primary key column for this table.
dept_id is a foreign key to dept_id in the Department tables.
Each row of this table indicates the name of a student, their gender, and the id of their department.
Table: Department
Column Name Type
dept_id int
dept_name varchar
dept_id is the primary key column for this table.
Each row of this table contains the id and the name of a department.
Write an SQL query to report the respective department name and number of students majoring in
each department for all departments in the Department table (even ones with no current students).
Return the result table ordered by student_number in descending order. In case of a tie, order them by
dept_name alphabetically.
The query result format is in the following example.
Input:
Student table:
student_id student_name gender dept_id
1 Jack M 1
2 Jane F 1
3 Mark M 2
Department table:
dept_id dept_name
1 Engineering
2 Science
3 Law


SELECT D.DEPT_NAME,
       COALESCE(COUNT(S.STUDENT_ID), 0) AS STUDENT_NUMBER              # TAKE CARE ABOUT THE 0 COUNT IN TABLE
FROM DEPARTMENT D
LEFT JOIN STUDENT S ON D.DEPT_ID = S.DEPT_ID
GROUP BY D.DEPT_NAME
ORDER BY STUDENT_NUMBER DESC, D.DEPT_NAME;

---------ANOTHER APPROACH------------

SELECT D.DEPT_NAME,
       CASE
           WHEN COUNT(S.STUDENT_ID) IS NULL THEN 0
           ELSE COUNT(S.STUDENT_ID)
       END AS STUDENT_NUMBER
FROM DEPARTMENT D
LEFT JOIN STUDENT S ON D.DEPT_ID = S.DEPT_ID
GROUP BY D.DEPT_NAME
ORDER BY STUDENT_NUMBER DESC, D.DEPT_NAME;

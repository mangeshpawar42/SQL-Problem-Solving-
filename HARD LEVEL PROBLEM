Q81.
Amazon wants to maximise the number of items it can stock in a 500,000 square feet warehouse. It
wants to stock as many prime items as possible, and afterwards use the remaining square footage to
stock the most number of non-prime items.
Write a SQL query to find the number of prime and non-prime items that can be stored in the 500,000
square feet warehouse. Output the item type and number of items to be stocked.
Hint - create a table containing a summary of the necessary fields such as item type ('prime_eligible',
'not_prime'), SUM of square footage, and COUNT of items grouped by the item type.
inventory table:
Column Name Type
item_id integer
item_type string
item_category string
square_footage decimal
inventory Example Input:
item_id item_type item_category square_footage
1374 prime_eligible mini refrigerator 68.00
4245 not_prime standing lamp 26.40
2452 prime_eligible television 85.00
3255 not_prime side table 22.60
1672 prime_eligible laptop 8.50

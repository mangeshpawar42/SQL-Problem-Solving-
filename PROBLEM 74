Write an SQL query to report the fraction of players that logged in again on the day after the day they
first logged in, rounded to 2 decimal places.

WITH CTE AS
(
  SELECT PLAYER_ID,
          MIN(EVENT_DATE) AS FIRST_LOGIN
  FROM ACTIVITY 
  GROUP BY PLAYER_ID)

SELECT 
    ROUND((COUNT(DISTINCT C.PLAYER_ID)/(SELECT COUNT(DISTINCT PLAYER_ID) FROM ACTIVITY)),2) AS FRACTION
FROM CTE C
JOIN ACTIVITY A ON A.PLAYER_ID = C.PLAYER_ID
AND DATEDIFF(C.EVENT_DATE,A.EVENT_DATE) = -1;

------------------------------------------------------------

WITH cte AS (
SELECT player_id, MIN(event_date) as first_login
FROM Activity
GROUP BY player_id
)

SELECT ROUND(SUM(CASE WHEN DATEDIFF(event_date, first_login)=1 THEN 1 ELSE 0  END) / COUNT(DISTINCT cte.player_id), 2) as fraction
FROM Activity as a
JOIN cte 
ON a.player_id = cte.player_id

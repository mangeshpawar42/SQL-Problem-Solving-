Table: Employees
Column Name Type
employee_id int

employee_id is the primary key for this table.
Each row of this table indicates that the employee with ID employee_id and name employee_name
reports his work to his/her direct manager with manager_id
The head of the company is the employee with employee_id = 1.
Write an SQL query to find employee_id of all employees that directly or indirectly report their work to
the head of the company.

    SELECT e.employee_id, e.manager_id
    FROM Employees e
    JOIN RecursiveCTE r
    ON e.manager_id = r.employee_id
)

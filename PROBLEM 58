Table: Cinema
Column Name Type
seat_id int
free bool
seat_id is an auto-increment primary key column for this table.
Each row of this table indicates whether the ith seat is free or not. 1 means free while 0 means
occupied.
Write an SQL query to report all the consecutive available seats in the cinema.
Return the result table ordered by seat_id in ascending order.
The test cases are generated so that more than two seats are consecutively available.
The query result format is in the following example.
Input:
Cinema table:
seat_id free
1 1
2 0
3 1
4 1
5 1

select c1.seat_id
from cinema c1, cinema c2
where ((c1.seat_id = c2.seat_id+1) or
       (c1.seat_id = c2.seat_id-1)) and 
    (c1.free = 1) and (c2.free = 1)
group by c1.seat_id

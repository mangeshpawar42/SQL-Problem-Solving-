Table: NPV
Column Name Type
id int
year int
npv int
(id, year) is the primary key of this table.
The table has information about the id and the year of each inventory and the corresponding net
present value.
Table: Queries
Column Name Type
id int
year int
(id, year) is the primary key of this table.
The table has information about the id and the year of each inventory query.
Write an SQL query to find the npv of each query of the Queries table.
Return the result table in any order.
The query result format is in the following example.
Input:
NPV table:
id year npv
1 2018 100
7 2020 30
13 2019 40
1 2019 113
2 2008 121
3 2009 12
11 2020 99
7 2019 0
Queries table:
id year
1 2019
2 2008
3 2009
7 2018
7 2019
7 2020
13 2019
Output:
id year npv
1 2019 113
2 2008 121
3 2009 12
7 2018 0
7 2019 0
7 2020 30
13 2019 40
Explanation:
The npv value of (7, 2018) is not present in the NPV table, we consider it 0.
The npv values of all other queries can be found in the NPV table.

SELECT Q.id, Q.year, COALESCE(N.npv, 0) AS npv
FROM Queries Q
LEFT JOIN NPV N
ON Q.id = N.id AND Q.year = N.year;

--------------ANOTHER APPROACH----------

WITH TotalNPV AS (
    SELECT N.ID,
           N.YEAR,
           SUM(N.NPV) AS TOTAL_NPV
    FROM NPV N
    GROUP BY ID, YEAR
)
SELECT Q.ID, Q.YEAR, COALESCE(T.TOTAL_NPV, 0) AS NPV
FROM Queries Q
LEFT JOIN TotalNPV T ON Q.ID = T.ID AND Q.YEAR = T.YEAR;
